# Overview

We can use types from other components by exporting them. Let's say we have no permission to do so, so we can extract them via their component.

# Greeting.tsx: the component that we want to use its types in another component

```tsx
// Greeting.tsx
type GreetingProps = {
  name: string;
};

export const Greeting = (props: GreetingProps) => {
  return <div>Hi, {props.name}</div>;
};
```

# CustomComponent.tsx

```tsx
import { Greeting } from "./Greeting";

export const CustomComponent = (
  props: React.ComponentProps<typeof Greeting>
) => {
  return <div>{props.name}</div>;
};
```
